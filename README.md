# Installation instructions:
In principle you should be able to install this on Windows / OS X / Linux using conda and 'conda install -c marcus-o s4'.
Install in a new environment to avoid incompatabilities.
I don't have a large test base, so I would appreciate if you let me know if it works (marcus.ossiander at gmail) or not, then I'll try to help).

# Detailed installation instructions (64-bit Ubuntu 16 or 18):
## Key steps:

```
git clone https://github.com/phoebe-p/S4
cd S4
make boost
make S4_pyext
```

## Installing relevant libraries etc.:

```sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install make
sudo apt install git
sudo apt install python3-pip
sudo pip3 install numpy matplotlib scipy
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
sudo apt-get install libopenblas-dev
sudo apt-get install libfftw3-dev
sudo apt-get install libsuitesparse-dev
```

- libopenblas installs OpenBLAS, to satisfy the LAPACK and BLAS requirements
- lib fftw3 install FFTW3, to satisfy the FFTW requirements
- libsuitesparse install libraries to satisdy CHOLMOD & related requirements

*If you have multiple Python versions, you make need to modify the S4_pyext part of the Makefile:*

````
pip3 install --upgrade ./
````

to e.g.:
```
[path of target python or virtual environment] setup.py install
```
